We will set out to prove
  (a - b)* = a* - b*
where * means complex conjugate.

We will do this by exploring through programming.

> write complex number class

Now that we have our complex number class, let's try a few examples.

> Try examples.

We have now verified the theorem for a few examples.
But this is not a proof you say.
Well, what if we try for 10000 different randomly generated examples.

It seems to hold up. It is very unlikely for there to be holes in the coverage of this theorem. Is that good enough?

No? Ok, well let's try it generally then.
